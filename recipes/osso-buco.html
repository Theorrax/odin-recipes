            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Ossobuco is a specialty of cross-cut veal shakes braised with vegetable, white wine, and broth. It is either
                    served with Gremolata, <a href="risotto-alla-milanese.html">Risotto alla Milanese</a> or polenta
                    depending on the regional variance. The marrow the hole in the bone, a delicacy, is the main feature of the dish.</p>

                <p>The two types of <em>ossobuco</em> are a modern version that features the use of tomatoes and the orginial version
                    which does not. The older version, called <em>ossobuco in bianco</em> is flavored with cinnamon, bay leaf and Gremolata.
                    The recipe featured today will be a modern version which features tomatoes, carrots, celery, and onion: <em>gremolata</em>
                    is optional. While veal is the traditional meat used for ossobuco, dishes with other meats such as pork have also been called 
                    ossobuco.</p>
