        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
            <p class="text-center"><em>Risotto alla Milanese</em> is, together with the Milanese cutlet and panettone, the most typical and well-known
            dish of Milan. It is a risotto whose main ingredients, in addition to those necessary to prepare a white risotto, are saffron,
            from which its characteristic yellow color derives, and ox marrow. It can also be served as a dish for 
            <a href="osso-buco.html">Ossobuco</a>, another typical Milanese dish. </p>

                    <li id="link-2">Pinch of saffron threads</li>
                    <li id="link-2">1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                    <li id="link-2">1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</1i>
                    <li id="link-2">1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                    <li id="link-2">2 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
                </ul>

        <h2 class="description">Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer; keep warm. In a large saucepan, 
                        heat the olive oil. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook over moderate heat, 
                        stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to thoroughly coat.</li>
                    <li>Crumble the saffron into the wine and add it to the rice. Cook, stirring, until the wine is 
                        absorbed. Add 1 cup of the warm stock and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until 
                        nearly absorbed. Continue adding the stock 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until it is 
                        nearly absorbed between additions.</li>
                    <li>The risotto is done when the rice is al dente and suspended in a thick, creamy sauce, about 
                        20 minutes total. Season the risotto with salt and pepper. Stir in the cheese, butter, and 
                        parsley and serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
