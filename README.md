# odin-recipes
Objective: Build a recipe website using HTML

This is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum, an open source community focused on teaching it's students to become 
full-stack web developers. The goal of this project is to teach students how to utilize basic HTMl elements to structure a
HTML boilerplate, utilize anchor and image elements, and practice using "href" attributes absolute and relative links. In addition to the HTML, students also will practice using commands in zsh, using Git and Github. 

Reflection: After completing the project I feel much more comfortable using HTML, Git and Zsh. 

This project reinforced my ability to create a HTML Boilerplate, use commands in Zsh to create files and directories, and use Git commands. Throughout the duration of the project, the most challenging aspect was using the commands in Zsh to navigate the directories and files. Practicing the navigation for the project has helped me retain the knowledge of moving through the directory more quickly. Overall, this project wasn't too difficult to complete only taking around 3-4 hours of work.
