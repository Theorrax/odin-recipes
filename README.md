Objective: Build a recipe website using HTML

This is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum, an open source community focused on teaching it's students to become 
full-stack web developers. The goal of this project is to teach students how to utilize basic HTMl elements to structure a
HTML boilerplate, utilize anchor and image elements, and practice using "href" attributes absolute and relative links. In addition to the HTML, students also will practice using commands in zsh, using Git and Github.
